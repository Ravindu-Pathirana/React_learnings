Array map() and filter() in React

1. map() function

The map() function is used to loop through an array and display each item in the UI.

In this project, map() is used to show a list of names on the screen.

Example use:
	•	Takes each name from the array
	•	Converts it into a JSX element (<li>)
	•	Displays all names as a list

👉 map() is mainly used for rendering lists in React.

2. filter() function

The filter() function is used to select specific items from an array based on a condition.

In this project, filter() is used to:
	•	Select only names that start with a specific letter
	•	Display only those selected names

👉 filter() is mainly used for showing filtered or searched data.
